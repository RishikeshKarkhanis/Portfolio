          <p>Hello! I'm Rishikesh Karkhanis, a passionate and dedicated student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering (AIML) at Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research, Indore.
            While my primary focus is on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning, I have a strong interest in Web Development as well. I enjoy building innovative and functional web applications, and Iâ€™ve worked on projects like Micro-URL, Task-Done, and more.
            One of my key strengths is that I'm a quick learner, always eager to explore new technologies and enhance my skill set. Whether it's AI, backend development, or full-stack web projects, I am always up for a challenge!</p>
